mEintopf is a feed reader with integrated one-click-reposting. It's supposed to enable your WordPress installation to become a selfhosted single-user soup.io clone.

Development is done on [Github](https://github.com/meintopf/meintopf), so I will read issues there first. I'll still try to monitor the forums here as well though.


== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Start adding feeds and reposting stuff in the 'mEintopf' menu in your admin panel
