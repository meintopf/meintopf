Feed reader with integrated one-click-reposting. Selfhosted single-user soup.io clone. Sort of.

== Description ==
mEintopf is a feed reader with integrated one-click-reposting. It's supposed to enable your WordPress installation to become a selfhosted single-user soup.io clone.

Development is done on [Github](https://github.com/meintopf/meintopf), so I will read issues there first. I'll still try to monitor the forums here as well though.


== Installation ==
1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Start adding feeds and reposting stuff in the 'mEintopf' menu in your admin panel

== Frequently asked questions ==
= Does mEintopf download images as well? =
No, it doesn't. However, there is another plugin for that, called Add Linked Images To Gallery. The original verion can be found [here in the Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/add-linked-images-to-gallery-v01/). I'm working on an updated version with a few fixes and new features. It's not here in the directory yet, but you can get it over at [GitHub](http://github.com/meintopf/add-linked-images-to-gallery/).

= How do I import my old soup.io content? =
I've written a [blog post](http://tech.tiefpunkt.com/2013/02/backup-your-soup-to-wordpress/) on that.

== Screenshots ==
1. You mEintopf Stream in the Admin panel.

3. Small note under each reposted item.

4. Widget showing the feeds you are subscribed to.
