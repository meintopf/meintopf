# mEintopf

Selfhosted soup.io-clone. Sort of. Maybe at some point in time. [![Flattr this git repo](http://api.flattr.com/button/flattr-badge-large.png)](https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=tiefpunkt&url=http://github.com/meintopf/meintopf&title=meintopf&language=&tags=github&category=software)

This is not suitable for production use quite yet. Honestly, not even close. And be careful, you need at least WordPress version 3.5 to use it. It _will not work_ with anything older than that.
